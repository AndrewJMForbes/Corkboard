An innovator, a problem solver, a free thinker... these are just a few of the many descriptors attributed to him. <br><br> If you were to ask him yourself, he would probably say he is just a humble kid from the east end of Pittsburgh, looking to make his place in the world. But the reality is, you could never really know Danny until you meet him, shake his hand, and let him tell you about his life.</p>
